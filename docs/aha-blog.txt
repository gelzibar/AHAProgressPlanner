Across my time as a software dev, I have worked on a variety of projects. However, I rarely have set projects up beyond my own. This is an exercise of how to approach this as someone with very little knowledge.

1. Initial Decisions
WHat's it take to get started on a software project? There's several decisions right at the front. 1) Source Control 2) Tech Stack 3) Local development environment

Additionally, I'd like to track effort and time spent on various work being performed.

Some values I want to prioritize: the content I'm using needs to be free. Additionally, I want to prefer speed.

Setting up a repo in github and I immediately run into license questions. Github points toward https://choosealicense.com/. Going with MIT. Simple. Permissive.

Regarding tech stack. I want to start with vuejs. I'm familiar with it and if I'm prioritizing speed, then having a baseline will help greatly.

Full Stack: DB, Server Management, Backend (scripting).

Regarding backend, I think nodejs (look at express for a microframeworks) However, djano may be a good opportunity for python. Looking up express

Going to start by setting up vuejs.https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#creating-a-vue-application 
1) Install Node.js
